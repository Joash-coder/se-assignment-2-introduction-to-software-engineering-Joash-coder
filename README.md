# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering encompasses the entire software development cycle while Traditional Programming focused  on writing code to solve a specific problem


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1.User and system requirements-involves the requirements of the users and other stakeholders.It includes gathering requirements, defining project scope, and creating a high-level plan for the software development process.

2.Design: focuses on designing the software's architecture, user interface (UI), and system components.

3.Development:programmers write the actual code for the software

4.Testing:This ensures code quality and that the project is working as intended with. Any weakness is noted and worked on.

5.Deployment:It is  deployed to the production environment where users can access it.

6.Maintenance:the software needs ongoing maintenance to fix bugs, address security vulnerabilities, and implement new features based on user feedback or changing requirements


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is an iterative and incremental development methodology while Waterfall is a linear and sequential methodology.
Key differences:
  Agile is iterative and incremental while Waterfall is linear and sequential
  Agile requires huge interaction with clients while waterfall is less involving 
  Agile method is flexible while Waterfall is rigid and fixed upfront.

Scenarios of preference:
   Agile is ideal for evolving requirements while Waterfall is ideal for well defined and stable requirements.


Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
It is the process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of the users,stakeholders and developers
The process involves gathering all the information and tools required for the project,analysing them carefully and validating them.
This is important for a clear vision,to reduce the risks and for proper project management.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity entails the decomposition of a complex software system into smaller, independent, and reusable building blocks called modules.It improves mainteinability in that fixes within a module are less likely to affect other parts.In addition, developers can work on a specific part without having to understand the entire code base.
Indepent growth and development can also be achieved.


Testing in Software Engineering:
Software testing entails a series of checks performed at different levels to identify and fix bugs or errors before the software is deployed to users.It is crucial for uncovering bugs and errors,ensuring that the software is working as intended and to mitigate risks associated with software defects.The different levels of testing include:
Unit testing: It involves individual units of code
Integration testing:tests how different units or modules interact with each other.
System Testing:tests the entire software system as a whole, including its functionality, performance, security, and usability.


Version Control Systems:
Version control systems are digital filing cabinet for your code, tracking every change made over time. This allows you to track individual contributions and merge changes seamlessly.
Popular Examples include Git and Subversion.


Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Project managers act as a bridge between various stakeholders, ensuring the project stays on track, meets deadlines, and delivers the desired functionality within budget constraints.
Key responsibilities include Planning,scope definition,team leadership and coordination,risk management,budget management.
Challenges faced include unclear requirements,resource constraints,lack of communication.


Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintanance is the process of modifying and updating a software product after it has been delivered to users.The different types of maintenance activities include:
Corrective Maintenace:fixing bugs and errors reported by users, identified during testing, or causing unexpected behavior.
Adaptive maintenance: modifying the software to adapt to new changes in its environment. 
Perfective Maintenance:enhancing existing functionalities without adding entirely new features
Preventive maintenance:aim to prevent issues before they arise.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues likely to be encountered include Privacy of the data and its security, bias and fairness in some softwares and transparency
Developers can ensure they adhere to etical standards by always staying informed on emerging ethical issues,champion for strong data security measures
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
